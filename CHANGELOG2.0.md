### v2.8.1

#### **Android Auto Headunit App v1.10**

*   HUD Support
*   USB/WiFi Switching Improvements
*   Various Codeing Improvements/Bug Fixes

#### **Video Player App v3.6**

*   Choose defaults for Shuffle, Repeat, & fullscreen
*   Video will resume where it left off after a phone call

#### **AIO Tweaks App v0.8**

*   Home & Playback buttons changed to icons
*   Added "Shell" tab and moved most of the shell commands
*   Controls change: Left/Right - Switch Tabs; Up/Down - Open Info Panel
*   Faster loading responses from shell commands
    *   Before response came through line by line via websocket (~.3 second per line)
    *   Now response is written to temp file and the file's contents are loaded & displayed. (~1 second per command)
*   **Show Version** - Shows FW Version
*   **Vehicle Data** - Shows Shared Vehicle Data
*   ~~**Reverse Cam** - Shows Reverse Camera~~ (_So close!_)

#### **Remove Message Replies**:

*   Set the **preset text messages** in _ANY_ available language even edit multiple languages.
*   After installing will prompt to perform a Factory Reset to apply message settings (or normal reboot, message setting will not be applied until the system is factory reset).
    *   NOTE: IF _"SKIP CONFIRMATION"_ INSTALL OPTION IS CHOSEN THIS PROMP WILL BE SKIPPED AND FACTORY RESET WILL BE DONE AUTOMATIICALLY

#### **Install Options:**

*   **Build "run.sh"**: Renames "tweaks.sh" to "run.sh" to be executed by autorun
    *   _Must have autorun installed prior to running_
    *   Only runs once when the system is booting up.
    *   Mostly for recovery purposes.
*   **Apps To Resources**: Install App Files To The "/resources" Partition
    *   Resources is about 3GB (rootfs is only about 500MB) mostly used for language files (because some regions have many languages available)
    *   **(v70)** If space on rootfs is low (under 5% free) apps will Be Installed to resources automatically
    *   _Recomended for all app installations_ (checked by default)

#### **CASDK:**

*   In AIO: Help/Controls/Info panel for each app when you click the app's image.

#### **Bug Fixes:**

*   **USB Audio Mod**: Fixed "Powered by Gracenote" text not displaying (normal & custom text)
*   **Pause On Mute (v70)**: Installation is skipped for v70+ because pause on mute behavior is built in.
*   **Boot Animations (v59.00.502+)** Fixed Custom Boot Animations, v59.00.502+ only one boot animation is used (LoopLogo in AIO Options)
*   **tweaks.sh**: Coding/Error handling improvements.
    *   AIO\_logs saved in `/bakups/` folder on USB now contain all error output from stdout & stderr
    *   Additional log is created `/bakups/info.log` with some general system information for troubleshooting issues if needed
    *   The Most important thing AIO does is create backups of the original system files before modifying them
        *   If a file backup fails the install will abort with a warning message
        *   This issue was seen on v70.00.021, Backups could not be created due to lack of disk space making it very difficult to revert tweaks.
*   AIO will use a default image when no image is chosen in the options (instead of hanging during compile due to missing image file) for tweaks that are expecting an image (Background, Change Blank Album Art, etc.).
*   Install Options tab is shown in all applicable views (CASDK, Full System Recovery & autorun).

### v2.8.0

CASDK
-----

CASDK is a micro framework that allows developers to write and deploy custom applications which integrate natively into the existing JCI framework without hassle. CASDK simplifies the app development process with a straight-forward, and slimmed down but powerful API. This version is integrated to run AIO apps alongside CASDK apps with no conflicts and imperceptible performance impact. Together they create a unique framework and a new realm of customization and application possibilities.

##### CASDK Comes With:

*   **CASDK Proxy** - Proxy registers both CASDK and AIO apps.
*   **Custom Application Runtime** - A microframework that handles the custom applications during runtime.
*   **Data Readers** - Poll vehicle data an certain intervals (1s, 60s, & 300s)
*   **JS logging** - JavaScript (and CSS) console log is written to /tmp/root/casdk-error.log
*   **LocalStorage** - Moves the save location of localStorage to /tmp/mnt/data\_persist/storage/
*   **NodeJS** - Powerful Server-side JavaScript.
*   **ADB** - Android Debug Bridge for Android devices.
*   **Custom Applications** - Apps that run on the CASDK framework

**AIO + CASDK Framework and Apps are installed internally to the 'resources' partition by default, optionally CASDK apps can be run from an SD Card.**

Native apps installed with AIO (Speedometer, Video Player, AA, etc.) will run on the CASDK framework although apps need to be installed differently with CASDK. The AIO Tweak installer will detect if CASDK is installed when running tweaks and adjust the installation accordingly but older app installers may not work while CASDK is installed.

CASDK apps have almost no impact on system performance, I encourage all developers to create one. Using the SD Card app method allows you to run any CASDK app even one you create yourself!

### CASDK Apps will be unlockable using codes found @ <https://mazdatweaks.com/casdk>

*   Simple Dashboard App will be available by default and 2 more will be available by visiting the blog and entering the codes.
*   I did not create any of the CASDK apps but I did make numerous enhancements and bug fixes, you may report CASDK bugs in the MZD-AIO Github Repository Issues Section.

#### Android Auto Headunit App v1.09 w/ Wifi Support

Instructions For Android Auto WiFi: 0. Before you start: Activate Android Auto developer mode by going to about and tapping the title bar until it says you are a developer 1. From Android Phone: Create Hotspot 2. From Vehicle: Turn on Wifi, connect to phone hotspot 3. Phone: In Android Auto app go to about screen menu and start headunit server 4. Android Auto will start automatically, if it does not or you get a black screen you can open Android Auto from the applications menu.

#### VideoPlayer v3.5

*   Fullscreen button toggles: Boxed - Keep Aspect Ratio - Fullscreen
*   Repeat is one button toggles: none - 1 - all
*   StatusBarNotifications for toggles
*   Video title will filter out the extension and turn underscores to spaces
*   Shows gplay error in error message
*   After hitting an error will make up to 3 attempts to re-start the video in 10 second intervals
*   Video Resumes where it left off when shifting out of reverse
*   Added to option "Resume Play" - when checked:
    *   Resumes the video where you left off if it was interrupted or the app was exited while playing.
    *   Saves video list to reopen and resume quickly (reloads if switch to music or press reload button)
    *   If the video is stopped and you are in the list view when you exit you will return to the list when reopened.
*   "Black Out Background" option - Will overlay all other GUI layers leaving only the video and solid black background
    *   If "Title to Statusbar" is checked, Video Title will show centered above video and time in the bottom left corner (but can be toggled with the multicontroller).
    *   This is ON TOP of all layers including the statusbar and bottom controls while the video player background is ON THE BOTTOM of all the other layers
    *   Pausing the video temporarily hides the overlay
*   In VideoPlayer Info panel (tab next to options) will show swap memory data and "unmount swap" button (if swapfile is present) - Makes an attempt to unmount swapfile on shutdown to avoid freezing. NOTES ON SWAPFILE: When using the swapfile it is recommended to use the "unmount swap" button before turning off and shutting down the system. If a significant amount of memory is "swapped" then the shutdown sequence is not enough time for the swapfile to fully unmount and the system will freeze. In the list view long hold down to check how much memory is in the swap cache, manually unmounting a few seconds before system shutdown solves the freezing issue.
*   Added Multicontroller 'hold' actions
    *   While media is playing:
        *   Up - Toggle Title
        *   Down - Toggle Shuffle
        *   Left - Toggle VideoPlayer Background (Behind Layers)
        *   Right - Toggle Blackout Overlay
        *   Select - Toggle Repeat
    *   Video List View:
        *   Up - Open Options
        *   Down - Open Info
        *   Left - Play Next Video
        *   Right - Play Previous Video
        *   Select - Select Last Played Video

#### AIO Tweaks App v0.7

*   Turn Off Display On startup **(Experimental)**
    *   Screen will automatically turn off after boot up sequence is complete.
    *   System will be fully booted before display is turned off
    *   Pushing buttons before the boot sequence is complete may have unexpected effects
*   If the touchscreen is NOT enabled while driving, AIO will display the word "Driving..." (This was to test the new 'Touchscreen While Moving' tweak to make sure I completely stopped the signal from reaching the GUI)
*   Also, will display the word "Stop!" when you stop (This was also for testing intercepting speed signals from the CMU)

#### Speedometer v5.7, Sb Speedo, & Date2Statusbar Tweaks

*   Option: Temporarily hide Sb Speedometer during Statusbar notifications
*   Date to Statusbar is not needed anymore with Sb Speedometer (icons will be moved above clock)
*   Note: If installing SB Speedometer and Date2Statusbar is already installed then reinstall (or uninstall) to update, this only need to be done once.
*   Icons for Trip Dist, Coolant and Intake Temp.

#### Touching Up The Classics

*   **No More Disclaimer & Order of Audio Source List** tweaks revamped and added support for FW v59.00.545+ & v70.00.000
*   Removed No More Disclaimer option 'Reduce Time To .5 seconds' to not complicate compatibility/because it is pointless.
*   Background Rotator window handles errors better and shows error messages when variables are outside of the boundaries. + A bunch of new backgrounds
*   Redone "App List Patch" for v59, this patch is applied during app installation for FW v59 only if both 'No More Disclaimer' & 'Order of Audio Source List' are not installed.
*   NOTE: **When installing apps on v59+ with AIO v2.8.0 for the first time only, "No More Disclaimer" and "Order of Audio Source List" tweaks will need to be reinstalled because of the new patch.**

- Dutch Translation by: Taeke

#### Autorun & Recovery - For Serial Connection

- Recovery files will be copied to "XX" folder be used with [these instructions](/serial)
- No installer is included, files need to be manually copied from USB Drive to CMU using a connected computer.
- **Only for gaining access via serial connection.**

##### Tweak Installer Changes/Fixes

- Fixed the NodeJS code to handle all errors and repair broken installations
- Removed the short lived "Use legacy install" because the new method will repair errors if they exist.
- This should solve the apps disappearing from the app list issues and fix all other app installation/uninstallation issues too.
- One additional file (/jci/opera/opera_dir/userjs/aio.js) is installed with apps containing some global AIO helper functions
- Separated from additionalApps.js to maintain backward and cross compatibility (with CASDK, cmu-opkg, and other older community developed mods/apps that install old versions of additionalApps.js will not break the new apps)

##### One More Thing

- Added "Load Last Compile" to the top menu and context (right-click) menu.

#### Test Mode (T/M) Button [(Thread)](https://trevelopment.win/jci-test-mode)
- Included with the **1 Second Diagnostic Menu** tweak because it is part of the Diagnostic App
- In v59 "JCI Test Mode" was disabled in the Diagnostic App
- This tweak brings back Test Mode for v59
- Makes it easier to get to in v55-v58 (Just press the T/M button)
- Once Test Mode is started type 11 to open the well known Test Menu

##### Tweak Installer Changes/Fixes
- App install/uninstall now uses NodeJS to add/remove from app list
- Allows for cleaner installations
- Backward compatible
- Solves the issue of all apps disappearing off the app list when only 1 is uninstalled due to improperly formatted JSON file
- "_Legacy App Install_" in install options to use the old method (using bash)
- The only reason I can think of for this is if you already have an improperly formatted JSON file then you need to uninstall all apps with legacy installer because the NodeJS code will throw an error. Other than that the NodeJS code will never
cause an improperly formatted JSON file.
- *Note: NodeJS will run from the USB drive, Coming Soon: Install NodeJS to the system*
- Cleaned up installer code
- Removed some superfluous code
- Fixed many inconsequential errors

### 2.7.6

* **Audio has to be playing from USB or button will function normally**
* After it has been done once or the first video is played the entertainment button will function normally
* You will see a split-second context change... that is the only way I could get the audio to pause.

- Ex: If CastScreen is not installed the CastScreen Start/Stop options will be hidden
- General little fixes
###### There are MANY failed legitimate attempts in the AIO Tweaks App code, most notable of which include "Show Backup Camera," "Take Screenshot" and global "Pause/Play Music". If you think you can get something to work that I have not, go for it!

##### Speedometer to StatusBar
- Now Speedometer to StatusBar moves the 'volume meter' and 'contact loading meter' a little bit to the left so they do not overlap the numbers.

#### Swapfile
- Choose to mount on boot (on by default) or copy without mounting.
- Mounted automatically when starting the VideoPlayer App
- Can be mounted manually with the AIO Tweaks App
- **Swapfile can be copied by itself onto the root of a separate USB drive containing music and/or videos and mounted during run-time as needed**

#### App Changes
- Skip Confirmation choice will persist

### 2.7.0

##### Android Auto v1.04
- __*Bluetooth Call Bug Fixed!!!*__ *Big thanks to @lmagder for fixing the headunit code after @Trezdog44 found the root of the issue with the 'Bluetooth call patch'*
- Video focus is lost at the beginning and end of a call due to the system expecting a context change. Press the FAV (<span class="icon-star"></span>) Button to get video focus back and AA will function normally.
- Phone button opens AA phone screen, also call buttons work for answering and ending calls.
- N\AV button opens the AA home screen
- Tap the black box on the credit screen to display contents of the headunit.log file.
- Added the Android Auto Icon to the statusbar
- (The 'Bluetooth Call Patch' from AA 1.03 is no longer needed from this version on.)
- (If it was applied will be reverted back to normal)

##### VideoPlayer v3.0
- Gave the VideoPlayer its own Icon
- Toggle Unicode Mode On/Off with "U" Icon (If you have a lot of videos you will see the difference in load time)
- Information/Options Panel, Open/Close with "i" Icon
- Close by pressing command knob
- Option: Hide/Show Unicode button
- Video Title to Statusbar
- Test Error Message
- I put this in for me to test the error message because all my videos are formatted **360p MP4 H264 AAC** so I rarely hit a memory error.
- Select options with left/right now includes reboot, show/hide background and info/options button.
- Memory Error Message is now very informative
- Offers Suggestions to Avoid Future Errors
- Changed highlight color to blue

##### AIO Tweaks v0.3

- Adds new icon for USB root button
- Set folders and song list icons correctly (were switched)
- Removes trailing "/" from folder names for list view and title of now playing

- **Full Width Titles** Option
- Titles will span the entire width of the screen.
- Will overlap album art if not hidden
- **Hide Album Art** Option
- Hides all Album Art

- **No More Beeps**
- Disables All System 'Beeps' (Those that are not be silenced by 'Settings > Sound > Beep' option).
- 'Improved List Loop > Remove List Beeps' option is redundant but only disables list scrolling Beeps, I see no reason to remove it.
- 'Remove Background Behind Buttons' is now **'Remove Background Overlays'** Options to Remove the Following Background Overlays:
- Behind Buttons (Original Tweak)
- **Now Playing** (Entertainment)
- **List View**
- **Text Message View**

- Options Under 'Main Menu Tweaks'
- Main Menu Layout: **FlatLine**
- Main Menu Text: **Color Text** & **Hide Text**
- Smaller Coins > **Small Focused Coin**
- **Remove Glow** (Behind Selected Coin)

##### Simplified Compatibility Check:
- Checked by Compatibility Group Based on FW version
- For better readability and to extend compatibility to cover all FW in the known groups.
- Compatibility Extended to: (Flavor and Region letters are irrelevant for these checks)
- Group 1 = All v55 & v56
- Group 2 = All v58
- Group 3 = All v59.00.300 - v59.00.399
- Group 4 = All v59.00.400 - v59.00.499
- A few specific checks are still done by FW these so certain tweaks may not install on unknown versions.
- Other than v59.00.500+ and v54- if you have a firmware version that does not fall in those ranges email me but I think that covers all of them.

###### Bug Fixes & Changes
- Wifi will now be enabled for Japan and NorthAmerica (From this point on Wifi is enabled for all no matter what region, previous installations are not be effected)
- 'Remove Message Replies' now also removes the TTS Message "End of the message" After Reading a Text Message.
- Must factory reset __*ALL settings*__ after installing to apply changes
- Fixed Bug where Install/Uninstall for 'Improved List Loop' would uninstall 'Shorter Delay Mod' and 'No More Beeps'
- Moved some of the tweaks around in the list
- Merged Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux projects into one so they are all on the same version. Required changes and improvements in the tweak building process and platform checks.
- Full Restore Script can be accessed from the left side navigation menu

#### 2.5.10
- Reworked v59 App List Patch
- Pro: Menu structure will no longer be broken (VSM submenu will be restored)
- Con: All apps that can come up on the list need to be added to the 'additionalApps' array in systemApp.js (I included every app I have ever seen or heard of including CASDK apps in the array you will only need to add custom developed apps)
- Patch to Full Restore Script to prevent potential bootloop when running with 'delete backups' option several times in a row.
- Replaced missing speedometer images
- Adjusted CastScreen, may fix issues for some.

#### Bug Fixes
- Replaced Missing Speedometer Images.
- Choosing Speedometer in Statusbar will auto-select Date to Statusbar Mod

### 2.5.9

**Fixed CastScreen-Receiver**

**Include AA v0.99 Install**

##### SSH_Bringback:
- A second root user/pass - jci/jci is now added.
- This is to give AIO a unique user to check the passwd file to ensure SSH is actually re-enabled.
- Added 'Force SSH' option that will force update SSH settings. For FW < 56.00.511 this will change the root user to cmu (and add second root user jci). - I personally did this on my v55.00.753A-NA and added a few of my own root usernames as well. -
  For more information I am adding a 'Pro Tips' page to MazdaTweaks.com The first entry will be about the importance of SSH access + how to add your own user/pass to your system. ##### JCI backup - Zip Backup Option - Creates a .zip file containing
  your backup JCI folder - Takes longer than a regular backup - You cannot create both a regular backup and a zipped backup in the same installation, that would take a very long time. - When an unknown firmare version is encountered AIO now does one
  of 3 things: - If FW < v55: Shows user a message that AIO is not compatible and they need to update to FW v55+ to use AIO. - If FW>= 58: Shows user a message that AIO is not compatible and a choice is given to make a JCI backup and instructions on
  where to send it to test for compatibility.
  - If FW = 55 or 56: All FW v55 & v56 will pass the initial compatibility check but **may not pass compatibility checks for certain tweaks** meaning those teaks will be skipped during installation.
  - Email aio@mazdatweaks.com if you need assistance with an incompatible firmware, unless you are have FW less than v55 then just update to v55 or higher.

  _**Force SSH and Zip Backup options are collapsed by default because they are only needed for certain situations and are not recomended to run with every install.**_

  ###### Added Compatible FW:
  - 59.00.446A-NA
  - 59.00.450A-NA
  - 59.00.447A-EU
  - 59.00.449A-EU

  ### 2.5.6

  - Of coarse if it keeps happening then reboot
  - Fixed a typo in the 'order of audio source' tweak
  - Fixed transparency in images when resizing especially 'blank album art'
  - Electron changed something in the resize API, now its faster. Cropping may be coming soon too!

  - All option choices AND recently played video list are saved to local storage.
  - More Touch Controls During playback
  - Control next/prev/ff/rw and more by tapping sections of the touch screen.
  - See [Touch Screen Control Map](/app/files/img/scrnCtrlMap.jpg) for details
  - Removing Navigation SD card **will improve video player performance** this is due to the memory issues that exist within the MZD system.
  - Installation of the swapfile will also improve performance, swap mounting has been improved.

  ##### Want more info on the Video Player? Check out the [Video Player Repository](//trevelopment.win/videoplayergithub)

  - **CUSTOM BOOT ANIMATIONS**
  - Change all or part of the boot animation (Default 'Disabled' Animation Uses Default LoopLogo for all 3 parts of the sequence allowing for the shortest boot time the illusion of no boot animation)

  - If this fix works for anyone let me know.


  ### 2.4.3
  - Did somebody say **VIDEO PLAYER MUTICONTROLLER SUPPORT??** YES I DID!
  - ButtonPress = Play/Pause
  - Tilt-Right = Next
  - Tilt-Left = Stop
  - Tilt-Up/Down = Scroll Video List
  - Rotate-CC/CCW = RW/FF
  - RW/FF Frame skip time lowered from 30s -> 10s
  - Because with the wheel rotation, 30 second jumps are too much
  - Speedometer Variant Option:
  - Start App In Analog Mode


  ### 2.4.2
  - Reverted Compatibility for 'Media Order Patch & FLAC Support' tweak.
  - Compatibilities with issues are neatly commented out in the code for testing purposes.
  - Toned down the warning message.
  - I appreciate all those who help out on this issue, Lets try getting these compatibilities all straightened out.
  - Choosing 'Media Order Patch & FLAC Support' will auto-choose SSH_Bringback (It can be unselected but that is not recommended).
  - Speedcam Patch Compatibility should be ok but should be **considered a beta test for FW. ver. 59.00.411A-NA & 59.00.443C-EU.**


  ### 2.4.0 Release
  - **Android Auto Bugfixes**
  - re-enables the dialer interface if the phone is paired and connected to the headunit via BT (Not Completely fixed, Still an Issue)
  - fix issue for screen corruption with backup camera
  - Increase the size of the USB receive buffer to 16384
  - I was a little nervous while confirming this because I have run AIO in my car hundreds of times - To apply "Remove Message Replies" tweak you **must factory reset your settings after installing**.
  - Since nothing bad happened to me after countless experimental system modifications, it is unlikely that factory resetting options would cause any damage.
  - Edit messages for your language in blm_msg-system.xml to start with your own preset messages.

  - Fallbacks Are Commented Out - So If You Really Need One You Can Get It
  - This Leaves Only One Assumption That AIO Follows: Any File That Has Been Modified Will Have A Backup Of The Original As A .org File.

  **MAJOR CODE REFACTORING**
  ###### Tweak Files - All around improvements in coding style, efficiency, logging, compatibility, commenting, and error handling
  ###### IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED NO-MORE-DISCLAIMER, ORDER OF AUDIO SOURCE LIST, OR IMPROVED LIST LOOP MOD ON FW V59 PLEASE REINSTALL (OR UNINSTALL) BECAUSE THE FILES USED IN YOUR INSTALLATION WERE NOT UPDATED TO YOUR FIRMWARE.
  ###### ALSO, YOU MUST INSTALL NO-MORE-DISCLAIMER OR AUDIO SOURCE LIST ORDER (OR BOTH) FOR APPS TO APPEAR IN THE APP LIST ON V59 ALL UPDATED FILES IN AIO V2.2.0 WERE UPDATED FROM FW V59.00.441A-NA SO CONTINUE TO BE CAREFUL (THOUGH ALL FW V59 SHOULD
  BE COMPATIBLE SINCE USING FILES FROM V55 ON V59 WAS STILL WORKING FOR THESE TWEAKS).

  - Status Notification Color Includes all types of notifications (not just nav).
  - **IT IS RECOMENDED THAT YOU UNINSTALL THE DATE TO STATUSBAR MOD V2 BEFORE INSTALLING V3. IT IS NOT REQUIRED BUT IT WILL PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS.**

  - 59.00.330A-EU
  - 59.00.331A-EU
  - 59.00.330A-NA
  - 59.00.441A-NA
  - 59.00.443A-NA
  - 59.00.443C-ADR
  - 59.00.326A-ADR
