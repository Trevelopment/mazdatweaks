#### **What is 'MZD-AIO-TI'?**

My good friend Siutsch copied files from many different tweaks for his infotainment system and thought, it would be helpful if you could choose what tweaks you wanted to install or uninstall. He went on to develop a CMD based program to accomplish this and it worked well but lacked that modern app feel and faced other limitations.  As a developer, I felt like I should upgrade AIO into a full fledged desktop app but with the same underlying tweaks that we all know from [AIO v1.5.x][1]. It was around that time I came across [Electron] and I went on to develop MZD-AIO-TI.

This Project has 2 particular aspects, user interface and the custom built installer script: **tweaks.sh** and associated files. @Siutsch and I continue to work together on that aspect to this project to optimize the tweaks.sh script for safety, efficiency, and in the future analysis.

### How to install:

###### Download and open the setup file and it will install and start up.

-   Select Desired Tweaks and Press the "Start Compilation" Button.
-   Insert a blank FAT32 USB flash drive to copy files directly to the drive
-   Or copy the contents of "_copy to usb_" (created on your desktop) to the root of a blank USB flash drive.

###### Before Car Installation:

-   Start with the vehicle off
-   Unplug any other USB drives from the car except this flash drive.   
-   ~~For installation of speedcam patch (see below), the NAVI SD card must remain in the car, because speedcam.txt file will be copied directly to SD card.~~
-   For installation of speedometer, the NAVI SD card must remain in the car too, without NAVI SD card a special patch will be installed, otherwise the compass is rotated 180 degrees.   
-   In general, the SD card can remain in the car during the tweak installations.   

#### Installation Into MZD Infotainment System:

-   Plugin USB drive, turn on car and wait for the "==  MZD-AIO-TI ==" window to appear (This may take 2 - 20 minutes so be patient).
-   At that point you will be given the option to continue or abort the installation.
-   Associated messages with pop up during installation (No further user interaction is needed).   
-   The system will be restarted automatically.
-   Remove the USB drive after restart.
-   Tweaks will be applied upon reboot.

_**Compatibility will be generally checked at the beginning of an installation, if your FW is not compatible the installation will abort at this point.  This is for the safety of incompatible systems.**_

##### The following tweaks are checked individually during installation of tweaks.sh, because there are different (config)-files to consider:

-   No More Disclaimer
-   Order of Audio Source List
-   List Loop
-   Date To Statusbar Mod


-   Apps check for v58+ to apply app list patch

    ##### Version 0.93A Change log

-   Working again with newer google play services

##### Version 0.92A/B Change log

-   When using fav key to switch to radio, track keys allow you to change between presets
-   When exiting AA, audio automatically switches back to radio
-   Added oppo to the vendor list

##### Version 0.91b Change log

-   Backup cam is no longer broken
-   Media keys work and voice button works
-   Press favorite key to toggle between AA audio and radio audio
-   Press home key to quickly kill AA
-   Some startup issues fixed

##### TODO:

-   fix phone
-   use track keys to switch radio stations when in radio mode
-   fix audio level issues (try skipping a song, then pause and press play again)

##### Version 0.83 Change log

1.  Performance improvements via sequential operation and removal of mutex locks - provided by @agartner
2.  Changed Video sink to mfw_isink - supposed to be faster and also now opera status (volume) bar can be overlayed if required - need some javascript expertise to make it a floating bar.
3.  Hide the disclaimer/credits after 2- 3 seconds
4.  Now you can touch drag/swipe
5.  Added VID for Lenovo

##### Version 0.7 Change log

1.  USB Audio is enabled - to actually use this, you need a separate USB thumb drive in one of the slots, as this is the only way for you to be able to select USB audio in the CMU. Please do not try to use MTP option on your android phone, as it is not going to work
2.  Since there was a severe case of audio stuttering once for me, I have included an option to disable USB audio and switch back to AUX. You can do this by placing a file called hu_disable_audio_out in the SD CARD (which, of course, means you now need an SD card ). I haven't actually tested this out as USB Audio worked fine at all times except that one instance.
3.  Nexus fix provided by @agartner

##### Version 0.6 Change log

1.  Voice control should not cause app to quit
2.  More VIDs added, including a possible fix for Nexus phones with VID 0x18D1

##### Version 0.5 Change log

1.  Voice control enabled
2.  More VIDs added, including a possible fix for Nexus phones with VID 0x18D1
3.  Graceful kill when reverse gear engaged - App will restart when reverse gear is disengaged. However, reverse camera is still dark (because same V4L device?) as app isn't killed fast enough.

##### Version 0.4 Change log

1.  Performance improvement to the gstreamer pipeline - testing shows no issues with Nav now. However, need some feedback to check if it is the same for everyone.
2.  Removed auto switch to Bluetooth as it causes problems with the UI. Need to switch manually now.
3.  Added a bunch of other Vendor id to Android USB Device VID list
4.  Removed aaserver and switched to websocketd.
5.  New gstreamer plugin h264parse compiled and added.
6.  UI now has USB/Gstreamer debug message window

##### Version 0.3 Change log

1.  Night Mode - Simple logic for now - 6AM to 6PM is day. Night afterwards
2.  First attempt at making libssl/libusb calls thread safe (Voice control will crash otherwise ocassionally).
3.  Increased USB send timeouts for better screen refresh.
4.  Added LG's Vendor id to Android USB Device VID list

##### Version 0.2 Change log

1.  Code sync with Mikereidis/Master
2.  aaserver - microhttpd server to launch and pass status back to UI - no more messy sh, watch and other hoops.
3.  UI integration using Herko ter Horst's method.
4.  Exit AA using on screen menu (last screen with speedo icon)
